React.js Project Kitchen-Kompanian
In collaboration with Mark McGraw, Brenton Haliw, and Will Reid

My main contributions were done to the Kitchen Stock portion of the application, KitchenStock.jsx

App is desgined to help roommates sharing food storage location such as a fridge, pantries, cabinents and refrigerators.
The idea is to 
  -help roommates stay organized of where their food is and whose it belongs too
  -Keep track of allergy foods
  -Keep track of eperation dates in food items
  -Keep track of how much food is available or left over.
  -Create a groccery list which can be accessible by any of the members in the house
